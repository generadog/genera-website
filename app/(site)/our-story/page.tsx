            <h2>It started with a handful of leads and a lot of heart</h2>
            <p className="text-ink-soft">
              In 2011, Duncan and Jess started Duncan&apos;s Dog Co as a dog
              walking service in South West London. It was just the two of them
              and a growing list of dogs who needed looking after during the
              day.
            </p>
            <p className="text-ink-soft">
              The business grew quickly. What started as a handful of walks
              turned into a full schedule. Then clients started asking about
              daycare. Then boarding. Before long, Duncan and Jess were running
              one of the busiest independent pet care businesses in the area.

              Over the years, Duncan&apos;s Dog Co grew into one of the

            <p className="text-ink-soft">
              One day, a loyal customer&apos;s pickup was missed. A booking had
              slipped through the cracks. It was the kind of thing that happens
              when you are juggling too many systems and not enough hours. It
              was embarrassing. It was avoidable. And it was the moment
              everything changed.
            </p>
            <p className="text-ink-soft">
              That customer happened to be a developer. Instead of leaving a
              bad review, he said something unexpected: &ldquo;I will build you
              something.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p className="text-ink-soft">And he did.</p>

            <h2>From prototype to platform</h2>

              That first version was rough. But it worked. Bookings stopped
              falling through. Invoices went out on time. Routes made sense.
              Over the following years, the software was refined, rebuilt, and
              improved. Every feature was tested in a real business, every day,
              by real people.
            </p>
            <p className="text-ink-soft">
              It was not built in a lab by people guessing what pet businesses
              need. It was built in the mud, in the woods, at the front desk,
              and on those late Sunday evenings that used to be spent on
              invoices.

            <h2>Sharing it with the industry</h2>
            <p className="text-ink-soft">
              After years of running Genera internally, Duncan and Jess
              realised something. Every small pet business they spoke to was
              fighting the same battles. The same spreadsheets. The same missed
              messages. The same Sunday evening dread.
            </p>
            <p className="text-ink-soft">
              They decided to share it. Not as some corporate product launch,
              but as one small business helping others. That is why Genera
              exists. It is software built by people who have been up at 7am
              with muddy boots, chased late invoices, and stayed up planning
              the next day&apos;s schedule.
            </p>
            <p className="text-ink-soft">
              We have been where you are. And we built the thing we wish we had
              from the start.
